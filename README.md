# NGramAnalyzer

This paper presents the design and implementation of an N-Gram
Analyzer in Java, supporting sequential, parallel, and distributed
modes using multithreading and Apache Spark. The system processes
large text datasets to compute n-gram frequencies and conditional
probabilities. We describe the architecture, detail the implementation
of each mode, and evaluate performance on datasets
